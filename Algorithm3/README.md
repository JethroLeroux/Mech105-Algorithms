## Algorithm 3: Integration Estimation Algorithm
This algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 method and the trapezoidal method to calculate an integration estimation for a user input function. It determines if the trapezoidal rule should be used on the last interval based on how many intervals there are.
### Inputs:
  x - vector of values
  y - vector of corresponding function values
### Outputs:
  I - the approximate value for the integral using numerical methods
